# Styled Components

Styled Components is a library for styling React applications using tagged template literals.

## Features

- **CSS-in-JS**
  - CSS directly within JavaScript with template literals.

- **Scoped Styles**
  - Styles are scoped to the component, preventing style conflicts and global CSS issues.
  - Each styled component generates a unique class name.

- **Dynamic Styling**
  - Props can be used to create dynamic styles based on component state or props.

- **Theming Support**
  - Built-in support for theming, allowing to define global styles and color schemes.
